# SCP-RP-Addons-for-Garrys-Mod
SCP:RP-style addons for Garry’s Mod, including scripts, SWEPs, entities and the SCP:RP gamemode. Free to use, modify and share under the MIT License, as long as proper credit is given and the original license is included.

Some of the content comes from FPtje (Falco Peijnenburg), such as the game mode DarkRP, which was changed to SCP:RP, and the corresponding modification.
In addition, I used OverlordAkise's stuff as the basis for my SCP:RP add-ons, but I adapted it significantly and created some of it myself.
